=head1 About this document

This page is the reference document for the recognizer objects
of Marpa's SLIF (Scanless interface).

=head1 Internal and external scanning

The Scanless interface is so-called because
it does not require the application to supply a scanner (lexer).
The SLIF contains its own lexer,
one whose use is integrated into
its syntax.
In this document, use of the SLIF's
internal scanner is called
B<internal scanning>.

The SLIF allows applications that find it useful to
do their own scanning.
When an application
bypasses the SLIF's internal scanner
and does its own scanning,
this document calls it
B<external scanning>.
An application can use
external scanning to supplement internal 
scanning,
or to replace the SLIF's internal scanner entirely.

=head1 Locations

=head2 Input stream locations

In this document, the word "location" refers
to location in the input stream
unless otherwise specified.

=head2 Negative locations

Several methods allow locations and lengths to be specified
as negative numbers.
A negative location is a location counted
from the end, so that -1 means location before the
last character of the string,
-2 the location before the second to last character of a string, etc.
A negative length indicates a distance to a location
counted from the end.
A length of -1 indicates the distance to the end of the string,
-2 indicates the distance to the location just before
the last character
of the string,
etc.

For example, suppose that we are dealing with input stream locations.
The span (C<0, -1>) is the entire input stream.
The span (C<-1, -1>) is the
last character of input stream.
The span (C<-2, -1>) is the
last two characters of the input stream.
The span (C<-2, 1>) is the 
second to last character of the input stream.

=head2 G1 locations

In addition to input stream location,
the SLIF also tracks G1 location.
G1 location starts at zero,
and increases by exactly one as each lexeme is read.
G1 location is usually not the same
as input stream location.
There is also a concept of G1 length,
which is simply
length calculated in terms of G1 locations.

G1 location can be ignored most of the time,
but it does become relevant to a small degree
when dealing
with ambiguous terminals,
and to a greater degree when tracing the G1 grammar.
(For those more familiar with Marpa's internals,
the G1 location is the G1 Earley set index.)

=head1 Current location

The SLIF tracks
the B<current location in the input stream>, more usually simply
called the B<current location>.
Locations are zero-based, so that location 0 is the start
of the input stream.
A location is said to B<point> to the character after it,
if there is such a character.
For example,
location 0 points to the first character of the input stream,
unless the stream is of zero length,
in which case there is no first character.

A current location equal to the length of the input stream
indicates EOS (end of stream).
In a zero length stream, location 0 is EOS.
The EOS location never points to a character.

In the SLIF, when the current input stream location
moves, it does not necessarily advance -- it
can skip forward,
or can be positioned to an earlier location.
The application can skip sections of the input stream.
The application is also free to
revisit spans of the input stream as often as it wants.

Here are the guarantees:

=over 4

=item *

Initially, the current location is 0.

=item *

The current location will never be negative.

=item *

The current location will never be greater than EOS.

=back

=head1 How internal scanning works

The SLIF always starts scanning using the C<read()>
method.
Pedantically, this means scanning always begins with a phase
of internal scanning.
But that first phase may be of zero length,
and after that,
internal scanning does not have to be resumed.

Internal scanning can be resumed with the C<resume()> method.
Both the C<read()> and C<resume()> methods require the application
to specify a span in the input stream.
The C<read()> method sets the input stream,
and that input stream is the one used by all C<resume()> method calls
for that recognizer.

In what follows, the term "internal scanning method"
refers to either the C<read()> or the C<resume()> method.
After an internal scanning method,
the current location will indicate how far
in the input stream the internal scanning method actually read.
If the internal scanning method was paused, the current
location will be the one at which it paused.
If the internal scanning method reaches EOS,
the current location will be EOS.
The return value of the C<read()> and the C<resume()> method is
the current location.

The following is a list of the events which cause
internal scanning to pause or to end.
More than one of these events may occur at a location,
in which case the
one listed first is the one that applies.

=over 4

=item *

An internal scanning method
will pause when it encounters certain lexemes,
as specified in the DSL using the C<pause> adverb.
The pause lexeme will be the one of those which caused
the pause.
(A pause can be caused by more than one lexeme.)
The pause span will be the span of the input stream
occupied by the pause lexeme.

=item *

Scanning always ends at EOS.
Reaching EOS is not considered a pause.

=item *

If its C<$length> argument was non-negative,
internal scanning
will pause when the current location is C<$start+$length>.
The pause lexeme and pause span will be undefined.

=item *

If its C<$length> argument was negative,
an internal scanning method
will pause when the current location is
C<$length + 1 + length $input_string>.
The pause lexeme and pause span will be undefined.

=back

=head1 The input stream

For error message and other purposes,
even external lexemes are required to correspond to a span of the input stream.
An external scanner
must set up a relationship to the input stream,
even if that relationship is completely artificial.

One way to do this is to put a artificial preamble in front of
the input stream.
For example, the first 7 characters of the input stream could be
an preamble containing the characters "C<NO TEXT>".
This preamble could be immediately followed by what is seen as the text
from a more natural point of view.
In this case, the initial call to the C<read()> method
could take the form
C<< $slr->read($input_string, 7) >>.
Lexemes corresponding to the artificial preamble would be read
using a method call similar to
C<< $slr->lexeme_read($symbol_name, 0, 7, $value) >>.

=head1 Constructor

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Scanless recognizer synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $recce = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new( { grammar => $grammar } );

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<new()> method is the constructor for SLIF recognizers.
The C<new()> constructor accepts a hash of named arguments.
The C<grammar> named argument is required.
All other named arguments are optional.

The following named arguments are allowed:

=head2 grammar

The C<new> method is required to have
a C<grammar> named argument.  Its
value must be
an SLIF grammar object.

=head2 ranking_method

The value must be a string:
one of "C<none>",
"C<rule>",
or "C<high_rule_only>".
When the value is "C<none>", Marpa returns the parse results
in arbitrary order.
This is the default.
The C<ranking_method> named argument is not allowed
once evaluation has begun.

The "C<rule>"
and "C<high_rule_only>" ranking methods
allows the user
to control the order
in which parse results are returned by
the C<value> method,
and to exclude some parse results from the parse series.
For details, see L<the document
on parse order|Marpa::R2::Semantics::Order>.

=head2 too_many_earley_items

The C<too_many_earley_items> argument is optional,
and very few applications will need it.
If specified, it sets the B<Earley item warning threshold> to
a value other than its default.
If an Earley set becomes larger than the
Earley item warning threshold,
a recognizer event is generated,
and
a warning is printed to the trace file handle.

Marpa parses from any BNF,
and can handle grammars and inputs which produce very large
Earley sets.
But parsing that involves very large Earley sets can be slow.
Large Earley sets
are something most applications can,
and will wish to, avoid.

By default, Marpa calculates
an Earley item warning threshold
for the G1 recognizer
based on the size of the
G1 grammar,
and for each G0 recognizer based on the size
of the G0 grammar.
The default thresholds will never be less than 100.
The default is the result of considerable experience
and almost all users will be happy with it.

If the
Earley item warning threshold is changed from its default,
the change applies to both G0 and G1 -- currently
there is no way to set them separately.
If the Earley item warning threshold is set to 0,
no recognizer event is generated,
and
warnings about large Earley sets are turned off.
An Earley item threshold warning almost always
indicates a serious issue,
and turning these warnings off will
rarely be what an application wants.

=head2 trace_terminals

If non-zero, traces the lexemes --
those tokens passed from the G0 parser to
the G1 parser.
This named argument is the best way to follow
what the G0 parser is doing,
and it is also very helpful for tracing the G1 parser.

=head2 trace_values

This named argument is passed on
to the G1 recognizer.
See L<Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"trace_values">

=head2 trace_file_handle

The value is a file handle.
Trace output and warning messages
go to the trace file handle.
By default the trace file handle is C<STDERR>.

=head1 Basic mutators

=head2 read()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Scanless recognizer synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $recce->read($p_input_string);

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF external read example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $recce->read( \$string, 0, 0 );

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Given a pointer to an input stream,
C<read()> parses it according to the grammar.
Only a single call to C<read()>
is allowed for a scanless
recognizer.

C<read()> recognizes
optional second and third arguments.
The second argument is a location in the input stream
at which internal scanning will start.
The third argument is the length of the section
of the input stream to be scanned before pausing.
The default start location is zero.
The default length is -1.
Negative locations and lengths have the standard
interpretation, as L<described above|/"Negative locations">.

Start location and length can both be zero.
This pauses internal scanning immediately and can be
used to hand complete control of scanning
over an external scanner.

On failure, throws an exception.
The call is considered successful
if it ended because a parse was found,
or because internal scanning was paused.
On success, C<read()> returns the location in the input
stream at which internal scanning ended.
This value may be zero.

=head2 value()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Scanless recognizer synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $value_ref = $recce->value();

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Has the same effect as a C<value()> call
on the G1 recognizer.
See L<Marpa::R2::Recognizer/"value()">.

=head1 Mutators for external scanning

=head2 lexeme_alternative()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF lexeme_alternative() example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

            if ( not defined $recce->lexeme_alternative($token_name) ) {
                die
                    qq{Parser rejected token "$long_name" at position $start_of_lexeme, before "},
                    substr( $string, $start_of_lexeme, 40 ), q{"};
            }

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<lexeme_alternative()> method
allows an external scanner to read
ambiguous tokens.
Most applications 
will prefer the simpler C<lexeme_read()>.

C<lexeme_alternative()> takes one or two argument.
The first, required, argument is the name of a symbol to be read
at the current location.
The second, optional, argument is the value of the symbol.
The value argument is interpreted as described for C<lexeme_read()>.

Any number of tokens may be read using C<lexeme_alternative()>
without advancing the current location.
This allows an application to use ambiguous tokens.
To complete reading at a G1 location,
and advance the current G1 location to the next G1 location,
use the C<lexeme_complete()> method.

On success, returns a non-negative number.
Returns C<undef> if the token was rejected.
Failures are thrown as exceptions.

=head2 lexeme_complete()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF lexeme_alternative() example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

            next TOKEN
                if $recce->lexeme_complete( $start_of_lexeme,
                        ( length $lexeme ) );

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<lexeme_complete()> method allows an external scanner to read
ambiguous tokens.
Most applications will prefer the simpler C<lexeme_read()>.

The C<lexeme_complete()> method
requires two arguments,
a input stream start location and a length.
These are interpreted as described for the
corresponding second and third
arguments to C<lexeme_read()>.
The C<lexeme_complete()>
method completes the reading of
alternative tokens at the current G1 location,
and advances the current G1 location by one.

Current location in the input stream is moved
to the location after the new lexeme,
as indicated by the arguments.
On success, C<lexeme_complete()> returns a number greater
than 0.
On unthrown failure, C<lexeme_complete()> returns 0.

=head2 lexeme_read()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF read/resume example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

   $re->lexeme_read('lstring', $start, $length, $value) // die;

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<read()> method performs internal scanning,
L<as described
above|/"How internal scanning works">.
It takes four arguments, only the first of which is required.
The first argument is the lexeme's symbol name.
The second and third arguments specify the span in the input
stream to be associated with the lexeme.
The last argument indicates its value.

The second and third arguments are, respectively,
the start and length of a span in the input stream.
The start defaults to the current location.
If the pause span is defined,
and the start of the pause lexeme is
the same as the current location,
length defaults to the length of the pause span.
Otherwise length defaults to -1.

Negative values are allowed and are interpreted
as L<described above|/"Negative locations">.
This span will be treated as the section of the input stream
that corresponds to the tokens read at the current location.
This correspondence may be artificial, but a span must
always be specified.

The fourth argument specifies the value of the lexeme.
If the value argument is omitted,
the token's value will be a string
containing the corresponding substring
of the input stream.
Omitting the value argument does not have the same
effect as passing an explicit Perl C<undef>.
If the value argument is an explicit Perl C<undef>,
the value of the lexeme will be a Perl C<undef>.

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    $slr->lexeme_read($symbol, $start, $length, $value)

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

is the equivalent of

=for Marpa::R2::Display
ignore: 1

    $slr->lexeme_alternative($symbol, $value)
    $slr->lexeme_complete($start, $length)

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

Current location in the input stream is moved
to the place where C<read()> paused or,
if it never pauses,
to C<$start+$length>.
Current G1 location is advanced by one.

On success, C<read()> returns the new current location.
On unthrown failure, it returns a Perl C<undef>.

=head2 resume()

name: SLIF read/resume example
partial: 1

    my $re = Marpa::R2::Scanless::R->new( { grammar => $self->{grammar} } );
    my $length = length $string;
    for ( my $pos = $re->read(\$string); $pos < $length; $pos = $re->resume()) {
       my ($start, $length) = $re->pause_span();
       my $value = substr $string, $start+1, $length-2;
       $value = decode_string($value) if -1 != index $value, '\\';
       $re->lexeme_read('lstring', $start, $length, $value) // die;
    }
    my $value_ref = $re->value();
    return ${$value_ref};

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<resume()> method takes two arguments,
a start location and a length.
The default start location is the current location.
The default length is -1.
Negative arguments are interpreted
as L<described above|/"Negative locations">.

The C<resume()> method resumes
the SLIF's internal scanning,
L<as described
above|/"How internal scanning works">.

On success, C<resume()> moves
the current location to where it paused,
or to the EOS.
The return value is the new current location.
On unthrown failure,
C<resume()> return a Perl C<undef>.

       my ($start, $length) = $re->pause_span();
       my ($line, $column) = $re->line_column($start);

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<line_column()> method accepts one, optional, argument:
a location in the input stream.
The location defaults to the current location.
It returns the corresponding line and column position,
as a 2-element array.
The first element of the array is the line position,
and the second element is the column position.

Numbering of lines and columns is 1-based,
following UNIX editor tradition.
A line is considered to end with any newline sequence
as defined in the
Unicode Specification 4.0.0, Section 5.8.
Specifically, a line ends with one of the following:

=over 4

=item *

a LF (line feed U+000A);

=item * 

a CR (carriage return, U+000D), when it is not followed by a LF;

=item *

a CRLF sequence (U+000D,U+000A);

=item *

a NEL (next line, U+0085);

=item *

a VT (vertical tab, U+000B);

name: SLIF trace example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

   my $literal_string = $re->literal($start, $length);

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<literal()> method accepts two arguments,
the start location and length of a span in the
input stream.
It returns the substring of the input stream
corresponding to that span.

=head2 pause_lexeme()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF trace example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

   my $lexeme = $re->pause_lexeme();

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<pause_lexeme()> method accepts no arguments,
and returns the name of the lexeme which caused the most
recent pause.
The pause lexeme is initially undefined
and it is reset to undefined at the beginning of
each call to the C<read()> or C<resume()> methods.


More than one lexeme may cause a pause.
When this is the case,
all the causal lexemes will be
acceptable to the G1 grammar,
and all the causal lexemes will have
the same lexeme priority.
When more than one lexeme causes a pause,
the choice of pause
lexeme is arbitary.
Applications may not rely on a particular choice,
or on that choice being repeated,
even when the choice is made
in similar or identical circumstances.

Not every pause is caused by a lexeme.
A pause often occurs because
of the length argument of an internal scanning method.
When the most recent pause was not caused by a lexeme,
the pause lexeme is undefined.
C<pause_lexeme()> returns a Perl C<undef> when
the pause lexeme is undefined.

=head2 pause_span()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: SLIF read/resume example
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

   my ($start, $length) = $re->pause_span();

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<pause_span()> method accepts no arguments,
and returns the "pause span" as a 2-element array.
The "pause span" is
the start location and length of the lexeme which caused
the most recent pause.
The pause span is initially undefined
and it is reset to undefined at the beginning of
each call to the C<read()> or C<resume()> methods.

A pause is not always caused by a lexeme -- internal
scanning may be paused
because of the length argument of an internal scanning method.
When the most recent pause was not caused by a lexeme,
no span can be associated with it,
and the pause span is undefined.
C<pause_span()> returns a Perl C<undef> if
the pause span is undefined.
