=head1 About this document

This page is the reference for the grammar objects
of Marpa's Scanless interface.

=head1 Constructor

The C<new()> method is the constructor for Scanless grammars.
An example of its use is L<above|/"Synopsis">.
The C<new()> constructor accepts a hash of named arguments.
The following named arguments are allowed:

=head2 action_object

Specifies the C<action_object> named argument that
will be used for the G1 grammar.
For details, see L<Marpa::R2::Grammar/"action_object">.

=head2 bless_package

Specifies the name of a Perl package.
The package is used
for blessing node values into a Perl class,
in conjunction with the
L<C<bless> adverb|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL/"bless">.

=head2 default_action

Specifies the C<default_action> named argument that
will be used for the G1 grammar.
For details, see L<Marpa::R2::Grammar/"default_action">.

=head2 source

The value of the C<source> named argument must be a reference
to a string which contains a description of the grammar.
The string's format is a domain-specific language,
described L<in its own
document|Marpa::R2::Scanless::DSL>.

=head2 trace_file_handle

The value is a file handle.
Trace output and warning messages
go to the trace file handle.
By default the trace file handle is C<STDERR>.

=head1 Trace method

=head2 show_rules()

=for Marpa::R2::Display
name: Scanless show_rules() synopsis
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $show_rules_output = $grammar->show_rules();

=for Marpa::R2::Display::End

The C<show_rules()> method is the equivalent of
calling L<Marpa::R2::Grammar's show_rules()
method|Marpa::R2::Grammar/"show_rules()">
for both the G0 and G1 grammars.
It is useful for showing the rules as they will
appear in trace and debugging outputs.
