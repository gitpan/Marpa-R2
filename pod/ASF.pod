=head1 Name

Marpa::R2::ASF - Marpa's abstract syntax forests (ASF's)

=head1 Synopsis

=head1 THIS INTERFACE is ALPHA and EXPERIMENTAL

The interface described in this document is very much a work in progress.
It is alpha and experimental.
The bad side of this is that it is subject to change from version to
version in major ways,
rapidly and without notice.
The good side is that field is 100% open for users
to have feedback into the final interface.

=head1 About this document

This document describes the abstract syntax forests (ASFs) of
Marpa's SLIF interface.
An abstract syntax forest, as the name suggests, is an abstract
syntax tree, generalized to contain the multiple trees that result from an
ambiguous parse.
ASF's are expected to have a high-level and a low-level interface.
The low-level interface is expected to be released first.
It is described in L<a separate document|Marpa::R2::Glade>.
