/* Default size is what GNU malloc can fit in a 4096-byte block.
     12 is sizeof (mhead) and 4 is EXTRA from GNU malloc.
     Use the values for range checking, because if range checking is off,
     the extra bytes won't be missed terribly, but if range checking is on
     and we used a larger request, a whole extra 4096 bytes would be
     allocated.

     These number are irrelevant to the new GNU malloc.  I suspect it is
     less sensitive to the size of the request. 
     If malloc were really smart, it would round addresses to DEFAULT_ALIGNMENT.
     But in fact it might be less smart and round addresses to as much as
     WORST_MALLOC_ROUNDING.  So we prepare for it to do that.
